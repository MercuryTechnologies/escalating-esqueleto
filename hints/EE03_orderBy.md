Given the examples, what data structure does `orderBy` take as an argument? And given the types of `asc` and `desc`, what type my the values in that data structure have?

For the return type, think about where `orderBy` is used within esqueleto syntax. What type would allow it to compose properly with other similar SQL clauses?
